# TSP-GRIP-Data-Science-TASK-2-
This repository contains the solution and dataset for my second task in Data Science and Business analytics internship at the Sparks Foundation. This is a Prediction using Unsupervised ML problem. The dataset used for this is the famous Iris dataset. 

The task is to find the optimal number of clusters using unsupervised learning. I have used Jupyter Notebook to solve this problem in python. The solution file is named as "TASK 2.ipynb"

Dataset used in this problem is uploaded with the csv file named "Iris.csv" in main. The same file is also available in the link - https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
